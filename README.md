# Gravity-Automatic
## Download, extract, process, and plot gravity data. From Topex website to simple bouguer anomaly contour (even more!)
Are you a Geophysics Student, doing research using satellite gravity data?
You may love this code!

I created code that could make you able to download, extract, process, and plot gravity data automatically from Topex website.

How to get started?

### 1. Make sure you have python IDE on your PC
This code was written in python language. To run it, you need python IDE (of course) with the version 3.7 or above. You can use any IDE (my recommend : Spyder, pyCharm).

### 2. Install necessary packages
You need to install some packages that may be you didn't have before. These packages list are :
